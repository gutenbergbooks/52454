      NE morning in early June I was walking on a crowded thoroughfare. The
      earth had rolled suddenly into summer skies. Birds chattered in the parks,
      and I could hear a cock crow in a passing freight wagon. I stopped to
      listen, while he seemed to hurl defiance at his captors and all the noisy
      crowd, and bid them do their worst to him. His outcry put me in

      mind of my own imprisonment there in the rock-bound city. As I thought of
      it, I could see the green hills of the North all starred with dandelions;
      I could hear the full flow of the streams that pass between them&mdash;you
      know&mdash;and that evening we were on our way to Hillsborough. Uncle Eb,
      then a &ldquo;likely boy&rdquo; of eighty-six, and Elizabeth Brower and
      Lucinda Bisnette were still in the old home. We had quickly planned a
      holiday to be full of surprise and delight for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were in the midst of the days that are few and silent&mdash;those
      adorned with the fading flowers of old happiness and thoughts which are
      &ldquo;the conclusion of the whole matter.&rdquo; As for ourselves, we
      found them full of a peace and charm I would fain impart to those who read
      of them, if that

      were possible. I know well how feebly I shall do my task, but now, at
      last, a time is come when it seems to call me, and I can begin it with
      some hope and courage. I shall try not to write a book, nor a tale even,
      but mainly to gather a few flowers, now full grown, in the garden of
      remembrance. You that see it growing lovelier in the lengthening distance
      will understand me.

    <p>
      Always, when our train went roaring into the quiet village, we used to
      look out of the car-window down across the river and a smooth stretch of
      fields into the edge of the little town. At a small, familiar opening in
      the shade-trees, almost half a mile from the train, we never failed to see
      the flicker of a white handkerchief. It signalled their welcome. And then&mdash;well,
      I doubt

    <p>
      if any one may have in this world better moment. Yes&mdash;that was years
      ago, and there are strangers in the old home, but to this day every time I
      enter Hillsborough I look for that flicker of white, away off among the
      trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day the signal greeted us, and was only one of many joys, for it was
      a day of a thousand, warm, and full of the music of birds and of bees'
      wings and the odor of new blossoms and a great happiness. Elizabeth Brower
      stood at the gate, and beyond her we could see Uncle Eb on the veranda,
      sitting in his arm-chair. The dear woman put her fingers on her lips, and
      we knew what it meant. Uncle Eb had fallen asleep in the warm sunlight. We
      greeted her with hushed voices, and approached the venerable man, and sat
      down at his feet, smiling

      and looking up at his fine old face. He continued to sleep, all
      unconscious that we were near him. Soon we heard him call in his dreams,
      just above a whisper: &ldquo;Here Fred! here Fred!&rdquo; It was the name
      of our old dog, dead these many years. His nap must have taken him far
      back&mdash;perhaps into that long, westward journey through woods and
      fields. I took his hand in mine. He came out of his dreams with a start,
      and looked up at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Wal, I <i>de</i>clare.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose and clung to our hands and looked into our faces with a full
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A merry birthday!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Bill Brower,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You've hearn o'
      the joy o' Paradise?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Often,&rdquo; I answered.

      &ldquo;Wal, here's the key-note o' the song,&rdquo; said Uncle
      Eb. &ldquo;Now look here, Liz Brower,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;you tell
      'Sindy we got to have the best dinner ever made by human hands. I'll
      bring some water.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth, Uncle Eb, and that daughter of Grandma Bisnette were there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope and her mother went into the sitting-room, and I followed them, while
      Uncle Eb went to the well for water. She looked up at us proudly as we
      stood before her, side by side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn around,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;an' let me look at ye
      careful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She surveyed the fit and material of Hope's gown with great
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look so ye was just goin' t' be married,&rdquo; she
      remarked.

      We sat down presently upon the ancient hair-cloth sofa, with its knitted

      old, plain, priceless things&mdash;the carpet, the pictures, a pyramid of
      plants and flowers in front of the large window, the centre-table, with
      its album and reading-lamp, the secretary and the what-not filled with
      books that were a part of our history.

    <p>
      There were the ingredients of that receipt which, as it were, had made the
      intellectual cake of my boyhood: Josephus' <i>History of the Jews</i>
      (the flour, two heaping volumes); <i>Ten Nights in a Bar-Room</i> (the
      milk and water, one volume); <i>Great Expectations, Bleak House), and
      David Copperfield</i> (the sugar, three volumes); <i>Pilgrim's
      Progress</i> (the egg, one volume); <i>Our Golden West</i> (the spice, one
      volume); <i>The Letters of Lord Chesterfield</i>

      Doom</i> (the fire that did the baking).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon we found Uncle Eb with my boy David upon his knees on the veranda,
      and he was telling him the tale of <i>The Witch's Bridle</i>, which
      I had heard in my childhood, and we stood and listened. It was a relic of
      old Yankee folk-lore and immensely true.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once there was a young man who lived with his father an'
      mother in a little village,&rdquo; the story went. &ldquo;An' there
      was a house in the village where a witch lived, an' it had a
      beautiful door. An' his mother told him that he must keep away from
      that house; but one night it looked so splendid that he opened the door an'
      went in, an' the witch spied him an' come and
    </p>

    <p>
      looked into his face an' he thought she was beautiful. An' she
      ast him to put on her bridle, but he said no. An' the ol'
      witch follered behind him as careful as a cat after a bird, an' what
      do ye s'pose she done?&mdash;waited until he was sound asleep an'
      put her bridle on him&mdash;that's what she done. Now, ye see, when
      a witch puts her bridle on any one it always turns him into a hoss, an'
      a witch's hoss can go right thro' the side of a house without
      makin' a hole in it, an' can jump over trees an' hills
      an' travel like the wind. She rode him high an' low, an'
      brought him back hum jest before daylight an' took off the bridle an'
      that changed him into a boy again. An' when he woke up he was tired
      out an' all of a tremble. An' ev'ry night the ol'
      witch come for him an' put on her bridle an'

      turned him into a hoss, an' rode him all over the hills an'
      valleys until he was about done fer, an' then fetched him back, an'
      ev'ry morning when he woke up he was a boy ag'in, an'
      was lame an' sore an' had a headache an' was sorry that
      he ever see the witch. He grew poor an' spindlin', an'
      he'd lay awake night after night to keep the witch away. But o'
      course he had to go to sleep some time, an' the minute he forgot
      himself she'd slip in an' put on the bridle an' away
      they'd go. An' he grew poorer an' poorer an' less
      an' less like a boy, an' more an' more like an animal.
      By an' by, he got used to bein' a hoss an' loved to go
      up in the air an' hadn't any more heart in him than my ol'
      mare.

      his bridle, he never changed a hair, but stayed a hoss. Why? 'Cause
      the boy in him was all wore out an' dead as a door-nail. Fact is,
      hosses can stan' more'n men. An' the witch grew sick o'
      him, an' said she wanted a better hoss, an' give him a cut an'
      turned him loose in the sky. An' ev'ry night fer years he
      galloped over the house-tops as if he was tryin' to find suthin, an'
      when I went to bed I used to hear him whinny way up in the dark, an'
      it sounded suthin' like this:&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he whinnied like the witch's horse, and went on:

      &ldquo;Keep on the ground, Dave, an' mind yer elders, 'cause a

      &ldquo;They want to rest,&rdquo; Elizabeth objected.

    <p>
      &ldquo;No; we'd rather go with Uncle Eb,&rdquo; said Hope, and we
      followed him to the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Godfrey cordial! hear the birds!&rdquo; Uncle Eb went on, as we
      took the path that crossed an edge of the clover meadow. &ldquo;Lot of
      'em been gettin' married, I guess. Don't do a thing but
      sing an' laugh an' holler&mdash;like a lot o' boys an'

      affected his breathing, but he was the same cheerful, keen-minded man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gardens are all right, but the sight of a hoe makes me shudder,&rdquo;
      said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hoe is a good teacher,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Man that don't
      hoe his character ev'ry few days won't have any.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife hoes mine,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' does it kind o' careless.&rdquo; He drew his hand
      over his mouth and cleared his throat and went on as if nothing had
      happened. &ldquo;These things are a good deal like folks. Some grow up an'
      some grow down. I used to know a woman that looked like a turnip, and a
      gal that was like a flower, an' another that was like a
      pepper-plant, an' a man that was a reg'lar human onion.&rdquo;

      He stopped and put his hand upon my arm. He glanced up at the sky, and
      seemed to note the direction of the wind.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, by mighty!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You stop, or you'll
      make trouble.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of Paradise Valley,&rdquo; I went on. &ldquo;It will be green
      and sprinkled with blossoms, and the brook will be singing as it goes by.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You quit!&rdquo; he answered, with a little gesture of impatience.
      &ldquo;Say!&rdquo; he suggested, with enthusiasm, after a moment, &ldquo;I
      wouldn't wonder but what the fish would bite&mdash;ye take it on the
      rapids there.&rdquo;

      Robins were building their nest on a shelf near him, and were busy with
      their fetching and weaving.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at the scalawags!&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;No, there ain't

      immediately after dinner.

      When we sat down to eat, Uncle Eb put the same old question:

    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About as usual.&rdquo;

      be pleasant. I got t' showin' the whites o' my eyes as

      concert to which we had taken him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll never fergit the man with a p'inter,&rdquo; he
      said, his head noddin with amusement. &ldquo;How he could toss the music!
      It was like spreadin' hay.&rdquo; Again his cheery voice, after a
      moment of silence: &ldquo;No more meat! Hope Brower, if you don't
      eat yer dinner, you'll be put to bed.&rdquo;
    </p>

      After dinner I gathered up my tackle.

      &ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; Uncle Eb remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great day for fishing,&rdquo; I insisted.

    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm 'fraid you better not go,&rdquo; said Elizabeth
      Brower from the door-step, with a look of anxiety, and now the trembling
      of his hands made me almost regret that I had tempted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here,&rdquo; said Uncle Eb, firmly, as he turned to my mother.
      &ldquo;He's picked on me 'til I can't stan' it any
      longer. Ye couldn't keep me out o' that buggy with a gun.&rdquo;

      I helped him in and took my place at his side, and away we went a pace of
      twelve miles to the hour, through town, across the flat, and up the
      stairway of the hills. We passed the old Hosper homestead.

      &ldquo;Wal, ye know, he had to live with himself,&rdquo; said Uncle Eb,
      &ldquo;an' he wa'n'. what ye might call good comp'ny.
      He couldn't help it, an' I always felt kind o' sorry fer
      Hosper. They got him so scairt over there at the white church that he was
      'fraid to live an' 'fraid to die, an' fer a long
      time he didn't do either. He thought it was his duty to suffer. God
      had cursed the world, an' that was the reason why men had to sweat
      an' toil. Think o' his days&mdash;full o' fear an'
      repentence an' atonement an' hell an' ancient history.
      He kind o' straddled his span o' life. One foot was in the

      &ldquo;'Deacon, I wouldn't wonder if the fish 'u'd

    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Fish!' says he, 'my mind ain't on fish. I'm
      thinkin' o' my immortal soul.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Man's soul is like his stummick,' says I.
      'It ain't healthy 'less he can fergit it. Come an'
      have some fun.'.rdquo; We rode in silence until Uncle Eb went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seemed to think that God was a kind of a bully, an' that
      he loved to make men cowards. It don't seem likely to me. I don't
      b'lieve He meant toil fer a curse nuther. I couldn't be happy
      'less I had suthin' to do. Seems 's 'o' them
      who wrote down the plans o' the Almighty made a mistake now an'

      did. No man can be perfect, specially when he takes holt o' so big a
      job. Prob'ly it was purty hot where they lived, an' work didn't
      agree with 'em. Now it looks to me as if that fust family couldn't
      'a' been very happy without a thing to do. I don't
      wonder that Cain an' Abel quarrelled. God must 'a' seen
      that the world lacked suthin' very important. So He blessed it with
      toil. I don't believe He ever intended to curse it, 'cause, if
      He did, ye got to own up that He ain't succeeded fust-rate.&rdquo;

      We came to the top of Bowman's Hill and looked down into the little
      valley, and were both silent.

      house and stable were in ill repair. Evil days had come to the neat and
      cleanly fireside, where in the old time Santa Claus had blessed us, and I
      had heard the cry of the swift and felt the touch of love and sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tenant, a man who showed the wear of hard times, put our team in the
      stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you'd stayed here,&rdquo; said he, with a glance at me,
      &ldquo;this farm wouldn't 'a' looked as it does now.

      Uncle Eb smiled.

      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;the farm would 'a' looked
      better, but he'd 'a' looked a dum sight wuss.&rdquo;

      of the bait-and-sinker type. Soon we made our way slowly through the same
      old cow-path that wavered across the green slope now starred with soft,
      golden blossoms. It is curious, that conservatism of the cloven hoof,
      which, like water, follows its old path, having found the way of least
      resistance. In a few minutes we came near the rotted stump of Lone Pine.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Hats off!&rdquo; said Uncle Eb, as he uncovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a second my hat was in my hand; or there, between our feet, was a
      lonely, half-forgotten grave&mdash;that of old Fred. Slowly, silently, we
      resumed our walk. My venerable friend was breathing hard. I supported him
      with my arm, and soon we sat down to rest upon a rock. The air was clear
      and still. There was not a cloud in the sky. A

      hawk flew across the flat near us, his white butcher's apron stained
      with blood. He was flying low, with some small creature in his talons. It
      made me break the silence, and I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a thing that puzzles me&mdash;the cruelty that is in
      all God's creation. It's a great slaughter-house, and
      everything that lives has the stain of blood upon it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It all teaches us that death ain't o' much account,&rdquo;
      said Uncle Eb. &ldquo;It looks like cruelty, an' most of us think it
      a curse. Death is a wonderful blessin'&mdash;that's the way it
      looks to me. Why, Bill Brower, ye've died twice already. Fust the

      We heard footsteps in a moment, and I turned and saw Jed Feary approaching
      us. He was past eighty years of age, and his hair and beard were white,
      and he walked slowly with a cane. He stopped near us, and began to laugh
      as we greeted him.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Heard you was here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an' Rans Walker
      druv me down the road.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;Stump ye t' rassle with me,&rdquo; said Uncle Eb, with a
      smile.

      what we've learnt in a hundred years. That little Devil, who rode
      across Europe killing an' burning an' spreading terror until
      they stopped him at Waterloo, he taught us a great lesson. He made us hate
      war, and that was the beginning o' the end of it. There were to be

      &ldquo;Yes; but the learned races will put an end to it by and by,&rdquo;
      he went on. &ldquo;The upper classes have all learnt their lesson&mdash;they

    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that's what's the matter,&rdquo; said Uncle Eb.
      &ldquo;They's some that 'ain't learnt any better than to
      fight an' quarrel, an' when they git rapped they're goin'

      &ldquo;But the great school ain't goin' t' be ruled much

      &ldquo;Wal, I'm goin' t' play truant an' go fishin',&rdquo;

      &ldquo;School's dismissed fer the day,&rdquo; said Feary, as he rose
      to leave us. &ldquo;Eb Holden, we're both likely to be promoted
      before long. We're like two boys who've been away to school.
      When we get home they're goin' to be glad to see us. Good-bye!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo;

    <p>
      So the old man left us, and we sat watching him as he crossed the brook
      and slowly mounted the green uplands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Purty good fishin' when Jed Feary's around,&rdquo; said
      Uncle Eb, as we slowly made our way to the edge of the woods. &ldquo;Growin'

      S we entered the cool woods and came where we could hear the song of the
      brook, Uncle Eb cautioned me in a whisper, just as he used to do: &ldquo;Now
      go careful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I found a rock at the head of a likely stretch of rapids on which he could
      sit comfortably as he fished. I prepared his tackle and baited his hook
      for him, and stood by as it went plunking into smooth water. Sitting
      there, he seemed to forget his feebleness, and his voice and figure were
      full of animation. His hair, as white as snow, was

      like the crown of glory of which David sings.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept hauling and giving out. Now and then, as he felt a nibble, he
      addressed the fish:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How d' do? Come ag'in,&rdquo; he said, as he continued
      to work his line. &ldquo;Tut, tut! you're another!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed, with a sharp twitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trout was a large one, and Uncle Eb, with a six-ounce rod, had not
      been able to lift and swing him ashore in the old fashion. He held on with
      jiggling hands and a look of great animation as the fish took line in half
      a dozen quick rushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're tryin' to jerk me out o' my boots&rdquo;&mdash;the
      words were emphasized and broken here and there by the struggle. The rod's
      vibration had got into his voice and all the upper part

      of his body. &ldquo;Stop that, ye scalawag!&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Consarn
      ye, come here to me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He seized the line, flung his rod on the shore, and began to haul
      vigorously hand over hand. When the splendid fish lay gasping at his feet,
      Uncle Eb turned to me and shook his head. He sat breathing hard, as if the
      exertion had wearied him. Soon he took out his jack-knife, a serious look
      on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go cut me an alder pole,&rdquo; said he, with decision. &ldquo;That
      thing ain't no better'n a spear o' grass.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I ran up the shore, glad of the chance he had given me to conceal my
      laughter. I cut a long, stout pole among the bushes, and returned,
      trimming it as I ran.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willie, hurry up!&rdquo; said he, with an eager look on his face,
      as if it were one

      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said he, trying the pole, &ldquo;that's a reg'lar
      stun-lifter. I can sass 'em back now. Put on the hook an'
      line.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment he gave his bait a fling, and assumed that alert and eager
      attitude so familiar to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut!&rdquo; said he, with a lively twitch. &ldquo;I dare ye to
      do it ag'in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the rod sprang upward, and a wriggling trout rose in the air, swung
      above the head of Uncle Eb, and fell to the earth behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, by gravy! that's what I call fun,&rdquo; said he.
      &ldquo;No, I don't want to torment 'em there 'n the
      water; 'taint fair. I'd ruther fetch 'em right out.&rdquo;
    </p>

      I unhooked the fish for him.

      business,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I can bait my own hook.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I left him and began to whip my way down the brook. It was good fishing,
      but the scene was by far the best part of it. What was there in those
      lovely and familiar shores to keep my heart so busy? The crows, hurrying
      like boys let out of school, seemed to denounce me as an alien. A crane
      flew over my head, crunkling a fierce complaint of me, and the startled
      kingfisher was most inhospitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      A small, bare-footed boy passed me, fishing on the farther bank. He had a
      happy face, and mine&mdash;well, I turned away for very shame of it. The
      boy looked at me critically, as if I were a trespasser, and I remembered
      how I felt years ago, when I saw a stranger on the brook.
    </p>
    <p>

    </div>
    <p>
      I remembered how, as a boy, I used to long for a watch-chain, and how once
      Uncle Eb hung his upon my coat, and said I could &ldquo;call it mine.&rdquo;
      So it goes all through life. We are the veriest children, and there is
      nothing one may really own. He may call it his for a little while, just to
      satisfy him. The whole matter of deeds and titles had become now a kind of
      baby's play. You may think you own the land, and you pass on; but
      there it is, while others, full of the same old illusion, take your place.
    </p>
    <p>
      I followed the brook to where it idled on, bordered with buttercups, in a
      great meadow. The music and the color halted me, and I lay on my back in
      the tall grass for a little while, and looked up at the sky and listened.
      There under the clover tops I could

      hear the low, sweet music of many wings&mdash;the continuous treble of the
      honey-bee in chord with flashes of deep bass from the wings of that big,
      wild, improvident cousin of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above this lower heaven I could hear a tournament of bobolinks. They flew
      over me, and clung in the grass tops and sang&mdash;their notes bursting
      out like those of a plucked string. What a pressure of delight was behind
      them! Hope and I used to go there for berries when we were children, and
      later&mdash;when youth had come, and the colors of the wild rose and the
      tiger-lily were in our faces&mdash;we found a secret joy in being alone
      together. Those days there was something beautiful in that hidden fear we
      had of each other&mdash;was it not the native, imperial majesty of
      innocence? The look of

      her eyes seemed to lift me up and prepare me for any sacrifice. That
      orchestra of the meadow spoke our thoughts for us&mdash;youth, delight and
      love were in its music.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon I heard a merry laugh and the sound of feet approaching, and then the
      voice of a young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary, I love you,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;and I would die for your
      sake.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The same old story, and I knew that he meant every word of it. What Mary
      may have said to him I know well enough, too, although it came not to my
      ears; for when I rose, by and by, and crossed the woodland and saw them
      walking up the slopes, she all in white and crowned with meadow flowers, I
      observed that his arm supported her in the right way.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took down my rod and hurried up

      stream, and came soon where I could see Uncle Eb sitting motionless and
      leaning on a tree trunk. I approached him silently. His head leaned
      forward; the &ldquo;pole&rdquo; lay upon his knees. Like a child, weary of
      play, he had fallen asleep. His trout lay in a row beside him; there were
      at least a dozen. That old body was now, indeed, a very bad fit, and more&mdash;it
      was too shabby for a spirit so noble and brave. I knew, as I looked down
      upon him, that Uncle Eb would fish no more after that day. In a moment
      there came a twitch on the line. He woke suddenly, tightened his grasp,
      and flung another fish into the air. It broke free and fell upon the
      ripples.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! ketched me nappin',&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I declare,
      Bill, I'm kind o' shamed.&rdquo;

    <p>
      I could see that he felt the pathos of that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess we've fished enough,&rdquo; he said to himself, as he
      broke off the end of the pole and began to wind his line upon it. &ldquo;When
      the fish hev t' wake ye up to be hauled in its redic'lous. The
      next time I go fishin' with you I'm goin' t' be
      rigged proper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment he went on: &ldquo;Fishin' ain't what it used t'
      be. I've grown old and lazy, an' so has the brook. They've
      cut the timber an' dried the springs, an' by an' by the
      live water will go down to the big sea, an' the dead water will sink
      into the ground, an' you won't see any brook there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We began our walk up one of the cowpaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One more look,&rdquo; said he, facing about, and gazing up and down
      the

      familiar valley. &ldquo;We've had a lot o' fun here&mdash;'bout
      as much as we're entitled to, I guess&mdash;let 'em have it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So, in a way, he deeded Tinkle Brook and its valley to future generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      We proceeded in silence for a moment, and soon he added: &ldquo;That
      little brook has done a lot fer us. It took our thoughts off the hard
      work, and helped us fergit the mortgage, an' taught us to laugh like
      the rapid water. It never owed us anything after the day Mose Tupper lost
      his pole. Put it all together, I guess I've laughed a year over
      that. 'Bout the best payin' job we ever done. Mose thought he
      had a whale, an' I don't blame him. Fact is, a lost fish is an
      awful liar. A trout would deceive the devil when he's way down out o'

      water, an' his weight is telegraphed through twenty feet o'
      line. When ye fetch him up an' look him square in the eye he tells a
      different story. I blame the fish more'n I do the folks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That 'swallered pole' was a kind of a magic wand round
      here in Faraway. Ye could allwus fetch a laugh with it. Sometimes I think
      they must 'a' lost one commandment, an' that is: Be
      happy. Ye can't be happy an' be bad. I never see a bad man in
      my life that was hevin' fun. Let me hear a man laugh an' I'll
      tell ye what kind o' metal there is in him. There ain't any
      sech devilish sound in the world as the laugh of a wicked man. It's
      like the cry o' the swift, an' you 'member what that
      was.&rdquo;

      We got into the wagon presently and drove away. The sun was down as I drew
      up at the old school-house.

      &ldquo;Run in fer a minute an' set down in yer old seat an'

      I went to the door and lifted its clanking latch and walked in. My
      footsteps filled the silent room with echoes, and how small it looked!
      There was the same indescribable odor of the old time country school&mdash;that
      of pine timber and seasoning fire-wood. I sat down in the familiar seat
      carved by jack-knives. There was my name surrounded by others cut in the
      rough wood.

      &ldquo;William Brower, stop whispering!&rdquo; I seemed to hear the
      teacher say. What was the writing on the blackboard? I rose and walked to
      it as I had been wont to do when the teacher gave his command. There in
      the silence of the closing day I learned my last lesson in the old
      school-house. These lines in the large, familiar script of Feary, who it
      seems had been a

      NE more scene from that last year, and I am done with it. There is much
      comes crowding out of my memory, but only one thing which I could wish
      were now a part of the record. Yet I have withheld it, and well might keep
      it to myself, for need of better words than any which have come to me in
      all my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christmas! And we were back in the old home again. We had brought the
      children with us. Somehow they seemed to know our needs and perils. They
      rallied to our defence, marching
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0062" id="linkimage-0062"> </a>

      up and down with fife and drum, and waving banners, and shouts of victory&mdash;a
      battalion as brave as any in the great army of happiness. They saved the
      day which else had been overrun with thoughts and fears from the camp of
      the enemy. Well, we had a cheerful time of it, and not an eye closed until
      after the stroke of ten that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, silence fell in the little house. Below-stairs the lights were
      out, and Hope and I were sitting alone before the fire. We were talking of
      old times in the dim firelight. Soon there came a gentle rap at our door.
      It was Uncle Eb with a candle in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I jes' thought I'd come in an' talk a leetle
      conversation,&rdquo; said he, and sat down, laughing with good humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Member the ol' hair trunk?&rdquo; he asked, and when I
      assured him that we

      href="images/8066.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </div>
    <p>
      could not ever forget it, he put his hand over his face and shook with
      silent and almost sorrowful laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'member years ago, you use' to think my watch was a
      gran' thing, an' when ye left hum ye wanted t' take it
      with ye, but we didn't think it was best then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I remember that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't s'pose&rdquo;&mdash;he hesitated as a little
      embarrassed&mdash;&ldquo;you've got so. many splendid things now, I&mdash;I
      don't s'pose&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Uncle Eb, I'd prize it above all things,&rdquo; I assured
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would ye? Here 't is,&rdquo; said he, with a smile, as he
      took it out of his pocket and put it in my hand. &ldquo;It's been a
      gran' good watch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&mdash;you'll need it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;The clock

      'll do fer me&mdash;I'm goin' to move soon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Move!&rdquo; we both exclaimed. &ldquo;Goin' out in the
      fields to work ag'in,&rdquo; he added, cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a glance at our faces, he added: &ldquo;I ain't afraid. It's
      all goin' t' be fair an' square. If we couldn't
      meet them we loved, an' do fer 'em, it wouldn't be
      honest. We'd all feel as if we'd been kind o' cheated.
      Suthin' has always said to me: 'Eb Holden, when ye git through
      here yer goin' t' meet them ye love.' Who do ye s'pose
      it was that spoke t' me? I couldn't tell ye, but somebody said
      it, an' whoever 'tis He says the same thing to most ev'ry
      one in the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the voice of Nature,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call it God er Natur' er what ye

      please&mdash;fact is it's built into us an' is a part of us
      jest as the beams are a part o' this house. I don't b'lieve
      it was put there fer nuthin. An' it wa'n'. put there t'
      make fools of us nuther. I tell ye, Bill, this givin' life fer death
      ain't no hoss-trade. If ye give good value, ye're goin'
      to git good value, an' what folks hev been led to hope an'
      pray fer since Love come into the world, they're goin' to have&mdash;sure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to Hope and put a tiny locket in her hand. Beneath its panel lay a
      ringlet of hair, golden-brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was give to me,&rdquo; he said, as he stood looking down at her.
      &ldquo;Them little threads o' gold is kind o' wove all into my
      life. Sixty year ago I begun to spin my hope with 'em. It's
      grow-in' stronger an' stronger. It ain't

      possible that Natur' has been a foolin' me all this time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little silence, he said to Hope: &ldquo;I want you to have it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her pleasure delighted him, and his face glowed with tender feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly he left us. The candle trembled in his hand, and flickering shadows
      fell upon us. He stopped in the open door. We knew well what thought was
      in his mind as he whispered back to us:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merry Chris'mas&mdash;ev'ry year.&rdquo; Soon I went to
      his room. The door was open. He had drawn off his boots and was sitting on
      the side of his bed. I did not enter or speak to him, as I had planned to
      do; for I saw him leaning forward on his elbows and wiping his eyes, and I
      heard him saying to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0067" id="linkimage-0067"> </a>

    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eb Holden, you oughter be 'shamed, I declare. Merry Chris'mas!
      I tell ye. Hold up yer head.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I returned to Hope, and we sat long looking into the firelight. Youth and
      its grace and color were gone from us, yet I saw in her that beauty
      &ldquo;which maketh the face to shine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Our love lay as a road before and behind us. Long ago it had left the
      enchanted gardens and had led us far, and was now entering the City of
      Faith and we could see its splendor against the cloud of mystery beyond.
      Our souls sought each other in the silence and were filled with awe as
      they looked ahead of them and, at last, I understood the love of a man for
      a woman.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
